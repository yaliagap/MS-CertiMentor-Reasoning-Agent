## 🎯 Personalization Flow

The system adapts to each student through a comprehensive input collection process:

### User Configuration Inputs

| Input | Values | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Certification Topics** | Free text (e.g., "Azure AI Fundamentals") | Determines which Microsoft Learn paths to search |
| **Email** | Email address | Used for reminder notifications (console simulation in MVP) |
| **Experience Level** | `beginner` / `intermediate` / `advanced` | • Learning Path Curator selects appropriate content difficulty<br>• Engagement Agent adapts motivational tone<br>• Assessment questions complexity |
| **Study Days/Week** | 1-7 days | Study Plan Generator creates realistic weekly schedules |
| **Daily Hours** | 0.5-8.0 hours | Determines session length and total plan duration |

### How Each Agent Uses This Information

**Learning Path Curator**
- Filters Microsoft Learn paths by difficulty matching user level
- Beginner → foundational paths, simple explanations
- Intermediate → practical application, real-world scenarios
- Advanced → deep-dive content, optimization techniques

**Study Plan Generator**
- Calculates total weekly capacity: `days × hours = weekly hours`
- Distributes learning modules across available days
- Adjusts plan duration to match realistic completion timeline
- Example: 5 days/week × 2 hours/day = 10 hours/week → 6-week plan for 60-hour curriculum

**Engagement Agent**
- **Beginner tone**: Supportive, confidence-building, celebrates small wins
- **Intermediate tone**: Challenge-oriented, practical application focus
- **Advanced tone**: Performance-focused, mastery emphasis
- Reminder frequency matches study schedule (5 days/week → no weekend reminders)

```
Level: intermediate
Days: 3 days/week
Hours: 1.5 hours/day
→ Result: 9-week extended plan, practical focus, flexible pacing
```

**Configuration 2: Full-time Student**
```
Level: beginner
Days: 6 days/week
Hours: 4 hours/day
→ Result: 3-week intensive plan, supportive tone, fast-track
```

**Configuration 3: Weekend Learner**
```
Level: advanced
Days: 2 days/week (weekends)
Hours: 5 hours/day
→ Result: 6-week plan, deep-dive content, concentrated sessions
```

## 📈 Exam Readiness Assessment System

The Exam Plan Agent uses a sophisticated multi-criteria decision system to determine student readiness.

### Intelligent Quiz Evaluation Process

Unlike traditional systems with fixed pass/fail thresholds, **the Exam Plan Agent evaluates the complete quiz** using AI-powered analysis:

**What the agent receives:**
- Complete quiz with 10 questions (domains, difficulty, Bloom levels)
- Student's answers for all questions
- Correct answers for validation

**What the agent calculates:**
1. **Overall Score**: Percentage of correct answers
2. **Domain-Level Scores**: Performance grouped by exam domain
3. **Domain Status**: Classifies each domain as strong/adequate/weak
4. **Critical Risks**: Identifies high-weight domains with low scores
5. **Readiness Status**: Applies decision logic (ready/nearly_ready/not_ready)
6. **Preparation Timeline**: Estimates days needed based on weak domains

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **No fixed pass/fail** - provides feedback at any score level
- ✅ **Domain-aware** - identifies specific weak areas
- ✅ **Personalized** - recommendations tailored to performance pattern
- ✅ **Actionable** - specific next steps for improvement
- ✅ **Intelligent** - considers exam weights and question difficulty

### Decision Thresholds

| Overall Score | Status | Recommended Action | Timeline |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **≥80%** + No critical risks | ✅ Ready | Book exam immediately | Within 1 week |
| **65-79%** | ⚠️ Nearly Ready | Delay and reinforce weak areas | 1-2 weeks |
| **<65%** | ❌ Not Ready | Rebuild foundation | 3-4+ weeks |

### Critical Risk Detection

A **critical risk** is identified when:
- A domain with **exam weight >20%** scores **<60%**
- Example: Machine Learning (30-35% weight) scoring 45% → Critical weakness

### Domain Status Classification

| Score Range | Status | Icon | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|------|---------|
| **≥70%** | Strong | 🟢 | Well-prepared in this domain |
| **60-69%** | Adequate | 🟡 | Meets minimum but needs reinforcement |
| **<60%** | Weak | 🔴 | Requires significant additional study |

### Preparation Timeline Calculation

**Formula**: `(number of weak domains × 5-10 hours per domain) ÷ daily study hours`

**Examples:**
```
Scenario 1: Ready Now
- Overall: 85%, All domains: strong
- Days needed: null (0 days)
- Suggested date: "within 1 week"

Scenario 2: Nearly Ready
- Overall: 72%, 1 adequate domain, 1 weak domain
- Days needed: 10 days
- Suggested date: "1-2 weeks from now"

Scenario 3: Not Ready
- Overall: 58%, 2 weak domains (high-weight)
- Days needed: 21 days
- Suggested date: "3-4 weeks from now"
```

### Confidence Level

| Confidence | When Applied |

}
```

### Quiz (Assessment Agent)

Generated by the Assessment Agent for student evaluation. The quiz contains domain-mapped questions that are later evaluated by the Exam Plan Agent.

```python
{
  "total_questions": 10,
  "difficulty_distribution": {"easy": 3, "medium": 5, "hard": 2},
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question_text": "Which Azure service is best for ML workloads?",
      "domain": "Azure AI Services",  # Maps to exam domain
      "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],

## 🔧 MCP Integration

The system integrates with Microsoft Learn via the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

**Endpoints Used:**
- `search_learning_paths` - Search for relevant learning paths
- `get_module_details` - Fetch detailed module information
- `search_certifications` - Find certification exams

**MCP Client:** `src/tools/mcp_client.py`
- JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Resource URL Flow:**
```
Microsoft Learn MCP
        ↓
Learning Path Curator (extracts module URLs)
        ↓
Study Plan Generator (includes URLs in DailySession.resources)
        ↓
Engagement Agent (uses URLs in session reminders)
```

This ensures every learning session reminder links directly to the correct Microsoft Learn module.
